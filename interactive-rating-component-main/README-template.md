## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While taking up this challenge, I learned how to store data within my localstorage so that I would be able to retrieve the stored data and display the data in the thank-you.html page.

Code snippets, see below:

```js

function rateClick() {
  var selectedRate = this.innerHTML;
  // console.log(rateNum);

  localStorage.setItem('rate', selectedRate);

}

```

### Continued development

- I would want to get comfortable with the use of JS (especially areas touching functions, methods, etc) by practicing, as it is fundamental langauage.
